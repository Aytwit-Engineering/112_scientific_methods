### Introduction
This repository contains 112 simple text files, one for each of the 112 scientific methods for self-transformation described in [Vigyan Bhairav Tantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vij%C3%B1%C4%81na_Bhairava_Tantra). It then uses [this repository's Issues Section](https://github.com/Aytwit-Engineering/112_scientific_methods/issues) to tag each method to make it easier to find which method may be best for you, and provide a way to create a discussion about everyone's personal experience.

### Reason For Being (Of This Project!)
I started investigating meditation in 2012 after becoming a father. I felt like I had to get my shit together a bit more and I kept hearing about it on podcasts and blogs and such, how everyone should do it in order to function at their best. My first experiences were with an app called [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), the [Wim Hof Method](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/), and Yoga videos on YouTube, particularly [Yoga With Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene). Headspace starts with simple 10-minute exercises where you count to 10 repeatedly, watch your breath, place attention on various body parts, and some more advanced practices from there. Wim Hof is centered on a particular deep-cycle breathing method and cold exposure. Yoga, practiced as originally intended, is not an exercise or even stretching, but a moving meditation that prepares the body for stillness.
