### Introduction
This repository contains 112 simple text files, one for each of the 112 scientific methods for self-transformation described in [Vigyan Bhairav Tantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vij%C3%B1%C4%81na_Bhairava_Tantra). It then uses [this repository's Issues Section](https://github.com/Aytwit-Engineering/112_scientific_methods/issues) to tag each method with a variety of labels. This hopefully makes it easier to find which method(s) may be best for you, and offer a way to foster a discussion about people's personal experience, what works, what doesn't. Tips, tricks, etc.

### Reason For Being (Of This Project!)
I started investigating meditation in 2012 after becoming a father. I felt like I had to get my shit together a bit more and I kept hearing about it on podcasts and blogs, how everyone should do it in order to function at their best. My first experiences were with an app called [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), the [Wim Hof Method](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/), and Yoga videos on YouTube, particularly [Yoga With Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene). Headspace starts with simple 10-minute exercises where you count to 10 repeatedly, watch your breath, place attention on various parts of the body, and then some more advanced practices from there. Wim Hof is centered on a particular deep breathing method along with cold exposure. Yoga, practiced as originally intended, is not an exercise or even stretching, but a moving meditation that paradoxically prepares the body for stillness. All of these were ways to prepare for the 112 methods discussed in this project, as far as my experience goes. Think of even the most simple scientific method from science class, like boiling water. You take for granted the skills and technology needed to accomplish it.

I practiced these preparatory methods for many years and branched out to studying and practicing many other methods from many other spiritual traditions. I also experimented with mind altering substances like coffee, alcohol, weed, mushrooms and acid. Coffee and alcohol may be surprising inclusions on this list but even these common substances have important lessons to teach. In hindsight there are better ways to learn those lessons, but you take what you can get!
