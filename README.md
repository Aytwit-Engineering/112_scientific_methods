### Introduction
This repository contains 112 simple text files, one for each of the 112 scientific methods for self-transformation described in [Vigyan Bhairav Tantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vij%C3%B1%C4%81na_Bhairava_Tantra). It then uses [this repository's Issues Section](https://github.com/Aytwit-Engineering/112_scientific_methods/issues) to tag each method with a variety of labels. This hopefully makes it easier to find which method(s) may be best for you, and offer a way to foster a discussion about people's personal experience, what works, what doesn't. Tips, tricks, etc.


### Hypothesis
Every scientific inquiry begins with a falsifiable hypothesis. Or at least that is this project's definition of science. Many fields are labelled science nowadays but they aren't necessarily 100% based on falsifiable hypotheses. Some fields are closer to zero percent. They may in fact be more like engineering, or pattern recognition, or even a religion, or even an intentional fraud. The falsifiable hypothesis for this project is: `Perform one or more of these methods and you will be transformed`. Big statement! And it's falsifiable simply by practicing the methods. The key is practice. Performance happens after practice. For most people the hypothesis will be IMMEDIATELY falsified. They will try a method or two, confirm that nothing has happened to them, and disregard it all as nonsense. They will also disregard the fact that even simple methods like turning flour and yeast into bread can take years to perfect, nevermind fundamentally transforming yourself.

This is where faith comes in. Faith?!? Mixing science and faith? Nonsense! But if you consider this deeply, faith is a basic requirement for science. Let's say I bring a cake over for your party. And it's delicious, everyone loves it. You ask me for the recipe, the SCIENCE behind the cake. I give it to you. You then try and try but can't replicate my science. I have given you a hypothesis and you have falsified it, or have you? Maybe I lied and bought it from a store or something. But most people would assume they're missing something obvious in the recipe, or lacking a required skill, or perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the wording. You have FAITH that the science behind the making of the cake is sound, you just need more practice and perhaps some additional guidance.

This is where this project fits in. This project is meant to bolster your faith in these methods so that you give them proper practice and don't simply throw them out after early failures. Because instead of making a cake, you're making YOU. And making you is not so easy. Simple perhaps, but not easy. Faith is required along with a truly scientific mind.

So `Practice one or more of these methods and you will be transformed`. But what does transformation mean? Look at it this way. There is an Innuit who has never seen water boiling. They know of fire but have never used it to boil water because they never light more than a tiny flame. I can give them a scientific method, along with equipment, to boil water. I can describe the result of BOILING using many words, but until they witness it, they don't know what boiling means. And even the idea of boiling water is misleading. It's not the water boiling, but rather the water being slowly transformed into another state of being and temporarily disturbing the non-transformed water in its path. Eventually all the water disappears.

You don't know what transformation means because you have never experienced it. This again requires faith.


### Personal Background
I started investigating this whole "meditation" thing in 2012 after becoming a father. I felt like I had to get my shit together a bit more and I kept hearing about it on podcasts and blogs, how everyone should do it in order to function at their best. My first experiences were with an app called [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/), the [Wim Hof Method](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/), and Yoga videos on YouTube, particularly [Yoga With Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene). Headspace starts with simple 10-minute exercises where you count to 10 repeatedly, watch your breath, place attention on various parts of the body, and then some more advanced practices from there. Wim Hof is centered on a particular deep breathing method along with cold exposure. Yoga, practiced as originally intended, is not an exercise or even stretching, but a physical meditation that paradoxically prepares the body for stillness. In hindsight all of these were ways to prepare for the 112 methods discussed in this project, as far as my experience goes. Think of even the most simple scientific method from science class, like boiling water. You can describe it in a few words, but if you start from nothing, you take for granted the skills and technology and even the space and time needed to accomplish it.

Before I came across the 112 methods, I practiced the aformentioned preparatory methods for many years and branched out to other methods from other traditions and teachers. I also experimented with mind altering substances like coffee, alcohol, weed, nicotine, mushrooms and acid. Coffee and alcohol may be surprising inclusions on this list but even these common substances have important lessons to teach. In hindsight there are better ways to learn those lessons, but you take what you can get!

From my very earliest investigations, I was always curious: how many different methods are there to meditate? Everyone seems to have their own method. What method or methods are right for me? Are there infinite possibilities or only a few? Are some of these methods bullshit?

Regardless of my curiosity, clearly there were benefits. I became physically stronger and more flexible, more durable. I healed quicker and could push my body further. I picked up skills faster. Amazing ideas and insights would come to me, sometimes in trickles, sometimes in floods. I could see through bullshit that I always thought was real. I could distance myself from emotions easier. This was all great but also very uncomfortable, very disturbing. I could see clearly that the more disciplined I was, the more I practiced, the better life was. That's a lot of responsibility! It's easier to stay average, believe me. If I needed to be at my best for a job interview, or a competition, or get out of a slump, I could just practice some of these methods and I was good to go. Like I was popping a pill.

But wait! I was trying to get away from popping pills! Or at least that's what I discovered along the way. I didn't want to simply be BETTER. Better is just a temporary reprieve. Then you have to be even more better to keep the ride going. Countless athletic champions will tell you of the intense depression that comes after achieving their dreams.
